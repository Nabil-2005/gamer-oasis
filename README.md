# Gamer Oasis

**Gamer Oasis** is a personal learning project to build a centralized gaming hub for exploring, sharing, and managing everything related to gaming. It‚Äôs designed to integrate modern web technologies, backend systems, and AI features while serving as a platform to continuously enhance programming skills.

## üöÄ Project Goals
- Learn and apply modern frontend and backend technologies.
- Implement scalable and efficient APIs using GraphQL.
- Gain experience in full-stack development with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Explore artificial intelligence integration for content recommendations and analysis.
- Practice agile development methodologies and manage a large-scale project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
This project will leverage the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: React, React Native, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo Server
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Hosting and Deployment**: Vercel
- **AI Integration**: AI/ML frameworks for game recommendations and analytics
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code hosting and task management

## üåü Features
The project is divided into multiple phases to align with agile practices. Key features include:
1. **Game Library**:
   - Search, browse, and save games to personal libraries.
   - AI-powered recommendations based on preferences and history.
2. **Community Hub**:
   - Forums for discussions, reviews, and collaborations.
   - Social features like profiles, chat, and activity tracking.
3. **Game Stats Tracker**:
   - Track stats for multiplayer games and sync with external gaming platforms.
4. **AI-Powered Tools**:
   - Personalized game suggestions.
   - Analytics for community trends and player stats.

## üîñ Phases of Development
The project will follow an agile methodology, split into several phases:

### **Phase 1: UI and Frontend Development**
- Design responsive and accessible user interfaces using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Create layouts for the Game Library and Community Hub.
- Build reusable components for cards, navigation bars, and modals.

### **Phase 2: Backend APIs**
- Set up **GraphQL APIs** using Apollo Server.
- Implement user authentication and game data fetching from public APIs.
- Use **PostgreSQL** for relational data and **MongoDB** for user-generated content.

### **Phase 3: AI and ML Integration**
- Develop recommendation algorithms for game suggestions.
- Use AI for forum moderation (e.g., detecting spam or inappropriate content).
- Create analytics dashboards for player and community trends.

### **Phase 4: Mobile App**
- Build a mobile app with **React Native** for seamless gaming experiences on the go.

### **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement**
- Add new features, optimize performance, and explore additional technologies like serverless functions and microservices.
